# Setup Instructions for GitHub Pages

## Method 1: Direct GitHub Upload (Easiest)

1. **Create a new repository** on GitHub named `yourusername.github.io` (replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username)

2. **Upload all files** from the `jekyll-theme` folder to your repository:
   - You can drag and drop files directly in GitHub's web interface
   - Or clone the repository and copy files locally

3. **Edit `_config.yml`** with your information:
   ```yaml
   title: "Your Name"
   description: "Your Title"
   email: your.email@example.com
   url: "https://yourusername.github.io"
   github_username: yourusername
   linkedin_username: your-linkedin-username
   medium_username: your-medium-username
   ```

4. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to repository Settings
   - Scroll to "Pages" section
   - Select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Choose "main" branch and "/ (root)" folder
   - Click Save

5. **Your site will be live** at `https://yourusername.github.io` in a few minutes!

## Method 2: Local Development (For Advanced Users)

1. **Install Ruby and Jekyll**:
   ```bash
   # On macOS
   brew install ruby
   gem install jekyll bundler
   
   # On Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev
   gem install jekyll bundler
   
   # On Windows
   # Download and install Ruby from https://rubyinstaller.org/
   gem install jekyll bundler
   ```

2. **Clone and setup**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourusername.github.io.git
   cd yourusername.github.io
   bundle install
   ```

3. **Run locally**:
   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```
   Visit http://localhost:4000

4. **Deploy**: Push changes to GitHub and they'll automatically deploy
