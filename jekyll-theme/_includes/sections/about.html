          Hi, I'm Nithilan Kumaran. I'm currently an Enterprise Business intern at Carrier, 
          where I'm expanding my experience in real-world development while continuing to 
          explore my passion for technology, programming, and problem-solving.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I recently completed my first year at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where 
          I'm pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering. I love sharing what I learn through 
          technical blogs and tutorials, especially on topics like game development and 
          developer tools.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Outside of academics and work, I'm an avid gamer—a hobby that often inspires my 
          creative projects and deepens my interest in how technology shapes interactive experiences.
