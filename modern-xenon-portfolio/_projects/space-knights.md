# Space Knights Items Shop

## Project Overview

Space Knights is an upcoming Roblox game launching in late 2025, and I had the opportunity to develop the in-game item shop where players can purchase weapons of varying rarities. This project showcased my skills in game development, UI/UX design, and algorithm implementation.

## Technical Implementation

### Core Features
- **Rarity System**: Implemented a comprehensive item rarity system with different weapon tiers
- **Search Functionality**: Developed a search function powered by the Levenshtein distance algorithm for improved usability
- **Animation System**: Uploaded and managed hundreds of animations for weapon previews
- **User Interface**: Designed intuitive shop interface using Roblox Studio

### Technologies Used
- **Lua**: Primary programming language for game logic
- **Roblox Studio**: Development environment and UI design
- **Algorithm Design**: Levenshtein distance for search optimization
- **UI/UX Principles**: User-centered design approach

## Key Achievements

1. **Performance Optimization**: Ensured smooth performance with hundreds of items
2. **User Experience**: Created intuitive navigation and search capabilities
3. **Scalable Architecture**: Built system to handle future content additions
4. **Algorithm Implementation**: Successfully integrated advanced search algorithms

## Challenges Overcome

- **Memory Management**: Optimized asset loading for better performance
- **Search Accuracy**: Fine-tuned Levenshtein distance algorithm for relevant results
- **UI Responsiveness**: Ensured interface works across different screen sizes in Roblox

## Impact

The item shop system significantly enhanced the player experience by providing:
- Fast and accurate item discovery
- Smooth browsing experience
- Intuitive purchasing workflow
- Scalable foundation for future updates
